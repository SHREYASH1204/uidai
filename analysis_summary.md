## Problem Statement
Identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, and predictive indicators in Aadhaar enrollment and update data to support informed decision-making and system improvements.

## Datasets Used
- **Biometric Data**: ~1.86M records across 4 CSV files
- **Demographic Data**: ~2.07M records across 5 CSV files  
- **Enrollment Data**: ~1.01M records across 3 CSV files

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed structure and quality of all three datasets
2. **Geographic Analysis**: Identified state and district-wise patterns
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Discovered daily, monthly, and seasonal trends
4. **Age Demographics**: Analyzed service usage across age groups
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Clustering, anomaly detection, and correlation analysis
6. **Predictive Insights**: Generated forecasts and trend predictions

## Key Findings
- Geographic distribution shows concentration in specific states
- Clear age group preferences for different services
